This is my modulular version of this code, however I could not get it to call my chart.js function properly and could not get the dynamic chart to run on this version, however after seeing how I could cut up this modular section of code from my origal project. I believe I either need webpack to make it easier which I will learn more about or my chart.js logic is messed up, or my html layout is missing something, of all 3 i guesses i would say it has to do with my modular chart.js.
